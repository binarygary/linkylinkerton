Why?  I ran into situations where I posted stuff and submitted it to facebook and during submission found an error.  Once the error was corrected on FB I found they had cached the URL so I needed to provide a new one to update.
You can probably think of better ways to use this though.

== Installation ==
Standard installation instructions.
